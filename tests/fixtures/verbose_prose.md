# API Documentation

When you want to make a request to our API, you need to first obtain an API key. The API key can be obtained by going to the developer portal and creating a new application. Once you have created the application, you will be able to see your API key in the application settings.

After you have obtained your API key, you need to include it in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. The format for the authorization header is "Bearer" followed by a space and then your API key.

The API supports three different types of requests. The first type is GET requests, which are used for retrieving data. The second type is POST requests, which are used for creating new resources. The third type is DELETE requests, which are used for deleting existing resources.
