# Document Without Header

This document has no compression metadata.
It should be marked as "untracked" since we cannot
calculate drift without a baseline.

This is a test document for the token drift detection system. It is designed to evaluate how well the system can detect when previously compressed documents have grown significantly due to new content additions.

The compression research project uses a unified theory where all compression techniques optimize three parameters: sigma (σ), gamma (γ), and kappa (κ), subject to comprehension constraints. This approach allows for systematic evaluation of different compression methods.

Token drift detection is a critical component because it identifies when documents that were previously compressed have accumulated enough new content to warrant re-compression. This helps maintain the effectiveness of the compression system over time.

The system works by comparing the current token count against a baseline stored in the document's YAML header. When the drift ratio exceeds certain thresholds, different recommendations are triggered: flag for monitoring, review for manual inspection, or compress for automatic re-compression.

This particular test document is carefully crafted to contain exactly the target number of tokens needed for testing various drift scenarios. The content is meaningful but repetitive enough to allow precise token count control. This sentence adds more tokens to reach the target count. Additional content helps test the token drift detection system. The algorithm must accurately measure document growth over time. Compression efficiency depends on maintaining optimal token ratios. Test documents require precise token counts for validation purposes. Token counting excludes YAML frontmatter but includes all other text. The drift detection system provides actionable recommendations. Threshold values determine when documents need attention. Automated compression maintains document quality and efficiency. Validation testing ensures the system works correctly. This sentence adds more tokens to reach the target count. Additional content helps test the token drift detection system.
