### Decision #7 - 2025-10-30
**Context**: Session 8 - Autonomous validation through Claude Code delegation
**Decision**: Execute validation plan through autonomous Claude Code task delegation rather than interactive development. Created comprehensive task system with TDD methodology and checkpoint validation for systematic execution.
**Rationale**: Session 7 created validation plan with 9 tasks requiring 15-30 hours of focused coding work. Interactive development would require significant context switching and back-and-forth iterations. Decision to delegate autonomous tasks with comprehensive specifications (500-800 lines each) proved highly effective. Created task system with: (1) TDD methodology (tests first → implement → validate), (2) 3-checkpoint structure per task, (3) Self-contained specifications with all context, (4) Clear dependencies and execution order, (5) Deterministic success criteria. First 3 tasks (Compression Score, Token Drift, Round-Trip Test) completed in ~45 minutes total with 100% test pass rate (54/54 tests). All implementations production-ready on first attempt without iteration.
**Impact**: Proven autonomous validation approach for remaining tasks. MVP validation (3 of 9 tasks) completed with minimal human oversight. Demonstrated that comprehensive task specifications enable high-quality autonomous execution. Efficiency gains: ~15 minutes average per task vs estimated 3-10 hours interactive. Quality maintained: 100% test pass rate, production-ready code, comprehensive documentation. Established pattern for Phase 2-3 completion: Task 1.1 (Content Analyzer) and Task 2.3 (Safety Checks) ready with same specification quality. Validation work that would take 1-2 weeks interactive can complete in 10-20 hours autonomous. Enables parallel execution (multiple tasks simultaneously). Positions project for rapid completion of remaining validation work. Key insight: Investment in comprehensive task specifications (1-2 hours) yields 5-10x time savings in execution. Success factors: (1) Clear test cases with expected outputs, (2) TDD enforced through checkpoints, (3) Self-contained context, (4) Explicit dependencies, (5) Production-quality requirements stated upfront.
