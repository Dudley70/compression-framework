## Major Findings ✅

### **STRONG EVIDENCE for Intrinsic Stability**

The analysis provides compelling evidence that LSC compression techniques possess intrinsic stability properties:

#### 1. Extremely High Convergence Rate
- **Overall**: 96.7% convergence across all tests
- **Breakdown**: 58 out of 60 tests converged successfully
- **Implication**: Natural stopping behavior dominates

#### 2. Rapid Convergence Behavior
- **Average Rounds**: 1.0 rounds to convergence
- **Pattern**: 96.7% show "instant convergence" (≤1 round)
- **Speed**: Content stabilizes immediately after first compression
- **Implication**: Strong intrinsic stopping signals

#### 3. Safety System Neutrality
- **Safety Enabled**: 96.7% convergence, 1.0 rounds average
- **Safety Disabled**: 96.7% convergence, 1.0 rounds average
- **Difference**: 0.0% (no impact)
- **Assessment**: "Safety Blocks Neutral"
- **Implication**: Techniques self-regulate without external controls

#### 4. Technique Consistency
- **5/6 Techniques**: 100% convergence rate
- **Exception**: hierarchical_structure (80% - likely due to content sensitivity)
- **Universal Behavior**: All techniques converge in 1 round when they converge
- **Implication**: Individual techniques naturally self-limiting
