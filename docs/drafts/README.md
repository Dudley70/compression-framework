# Draft Files Note - Session 6

**Location**: `docs/drafts/`  
**Status**: Temporary working files, not tracked in INDEX.md  
**Purpose**: Intermediate analysis during dimensional research

## Files Present

1. **unified-compression-theory.md** (16,860 bytes)
   - Initial analysis of unified (σ, γ, κ) model
   - Parameter definitions and testing
   - Created during Session 6 research
   - Superseded by: docs/research/dimensional-analysis-research.md

2. **lsc-techniques-analysis.md** (10,690 bytes)
   - LSC's 5 techniques mapped to σ parameter
   - Framework extensions mapped to γ and κ
   - Created during Session 6 research
   - Integrated into: docs/research/dimensional-analysis-research.md

3. **next-session-briefing.md** (35,830 bytes)
   - Complete briefing for Session 6 white paper planning
   - Includes unified theory, white paper outline, research objectives
   - Created at end of Session 5 before context limit
   - Now historical: dimensional analysis completed, conclusions different

## Status

**Action Required**: None - these are working drafts
- Can be deleted after Session 6 verified complete
- Or kept as historical record of research process
- Not referenced by any permanent documents

**Note**: The dimensional analysis research concluded differently than initial briefing anticipated:
- Briefing suggested 6-7D model might be needed
- Research validated 3D model as complete for defined scope
- This is good - shows rigorous evaluation led to simpler, better conclusion

**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Session**: 6
