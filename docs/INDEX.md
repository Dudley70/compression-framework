## Active Documents

### Research

**[Context Compression Method](research/context-compression-method.md)** - Active - Conversational compression technique for verbose AI responses (99.5%+ compression ratios). Post-session retrospective compression using multi-tier strategy with structured JSON summaries. Source: CC_Projects analysis.

**[LSC Framework Overview](research/lsc/README.md)** - Active - Quick reference for LLM-Shorthand Context (LSC) compression framework. Achieves 70-85% token reduction for documentation through machine-first structured format.

**[LSC Complete Framework](research/lsc/LSC_CONTEXT_EFFICIENCY.md)** - Active - Comprehensive 3,247-line guide to LSC framework. Covers core principles, schema design, file-based implementation (70% reduction), retrieval-augmented future (85% reduction), universal interop, output contracts, migration strategies, and reference implementations.

### Analysis

**[Documentation Types Matrix](analysis/documentation-types-matrix.md)** - Active - Comprehensive taxonomy (1,030 lines) defining six audience categories (LLM-only, hybrid-technical, hybrid-general, human-technical, human-general, archival) with specific compression targets (70-85%, 40-60%, 20-40%, 0-10%, 0%, 95-99%). Includes decision framework, comprehension requirements, and 7 example transformations.

**[Information Preservation Framework](analysis/information-preservation-framework.md)** - Active - Systematic framework (919 lines) for purpose-driven compression. Comprehensive taxonomy of 7 documentation purposes (execution, learning, reference, audit, communication, analysis, maintenance) with essential information mapping, preservation decision matrices, 5 compression methods, validation framework, and systematic analysis process. Answers "what can be safely stripped" based on "why we're documenting."

### Plans

**[CC_Projects Compression Tasks](plans/CC_PROJECTS_COMPRESSION_TASKS.md)** - Active - Structured 7-phase roadmap (270 lines) for systematically applying Compression framework to CC_Projects document types. Layer-by-layer approach (Session → Strategic → Control → Operational → Archive) with role-based optimization, phase-aware temporal compression, and framework refinement. Estimated 60-75 hours phased implementation.

### Proposals

### Reference

**[CC_Projects Validated Architecture](reference/CC_PROJECTS_VALIDATED_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Active - Comprehensive reference (994 lines) documenting CC_Projects Phase 2 validation (H1-H4). Provides evidence-based architectural context grounding Compression framework: 5-phase lifecycle, 6 roles, 5 layers, scalability validation. Includes document type mapping, compression implications, concrete test cases, and integration recommendations.
