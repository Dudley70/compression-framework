## Active Documents

### Research

**[Context Compression Method](research/context-compression-method.md)** - Active - Conversational compression technique for verbose AI responses (99.5%+ compression ratios).

**[Dimensional Analysis Research](research/dimensional-analysis-research.md)** - Active - Comprehensive evaluation (832 lines) validating 3D model (σ, γ, κ) is complete for project-scale LLM context compression. Evaluated 6 candidate dimensions across 4 academic domains.

**[Compression Automation Tool Research](research/compression-automation-tool-research.md)** - Active - Research findings (426 lines) for Python-based compression automation tool. Session 7 pivot identified superior session-based approach leveraging Claude's project context vs ML pipeline.

**[LSC Framework Overview](research/lsc/README.md)** - Active - Quick reference for LLM-Shorthand Context (LSC) compression framework.

**[LSC Complete Framework](research/lsc/LSC_CONTEXT_EFFICIENCY.md)** - Active - Comprehensive 3,247-line guide to LSC framework.

### Analysis

**[Method Relationship Analysis](analysis/method-relationship-analysis.md)** - Active - **CRITICAL clarification** (736 lines) documenting that LSC and CCM are complementary methods addressing different problems (documentation vs conversation compression), not overlapping techniques. Defines LSC's 5 specific techniques, CCM's 4 specific techniques, their relationship, and our framework's unique contributions. Essential for correct empirical testing design and academic attribution.

**[Documentation Types Matrix](analysis/documentation-types-matrix.md)** - Active - Comprehensive taxonomy (1,691 lines) defining six audience categories with compression targets.

**[Information Preservation Framework](analysis/information-preservation-framework.md)** - Active - Systematic framework (1,808 lines) for purpose-driven compression.

**[CC_Projects Alignment Review](analysis/cc-projects-alignment-review.md)** - Active - Deep alignment analysis (756 lines) validating Compression framework against CC_Projects architecture.

### Plans

**[Automation Tool Validation Plan](plans/AUTOMATION_TOOL_VALIDATION_PLAN.md)** - Active - Comprehensive validation plan (575 lines) for three critical design questions: mixed compression states, idempotency protection, proactive style optimization. Structured tasks with test cases and success criteria. MVP requirements: compression score, round-trip test, token drift detection.

**[CC_Projects Compression Tasks](plans/CC_PROJECTS_COMPRESSION_TASKS.md)** - Active - Structured 7-phase roadmap (270 lines) for applying framework to CC_Projects.

### Reference

**[CC_Projects Validated Architecture](reference/CC_PROJECTS_VALIDATED_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Active - Comprehensive reference (994 lines) documenting CC_Projects Phase 2 validation.

**[Document Header Specification](reference/DOCUMENT_HEADER_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Active - Comprehensive YAML frontmatter specification (2,073 lines) for document metadata. Defines structured headers enabling intelligent compression decisions, compression tracking, and style guidance. Covers 13 document types with validation rules and usage patterns. Validated with 14/14 tests passing.

**[Integration Guide for CC_Projects](reference/INTEGRATION_GUIDE_CC_PROJECTS.md)** - Active - Enhanced practical adoption guide (989 lines, updated 2025-10-30) for implementing Compression framework. **NEW: Three clarification sections added** addressing CC_Projects Phase 3 feedback: (1) Multiple entry points (template design, active compression, theory analysis), (2) Framework as reference not prescription (clarifies what framework provides vs prescribes), (3) Purpose→parameter mapping (explains how purpose-driven analysis translates to σ,γ,κ values), (4) Special Phase 3 guidance (using compression targets as template design constraints). Shows how unified theory formalizes empirical compression patterns rather than replacing purpose-driven thinking. Provides concrete Phase 3 application examples (SESSION.md template, DECISIONS.md template, TASKS.md template) with step-by-step validation process.

### Patterns

**[Multi-Dimensional Compression Matrix](patterns/multi-dimensional-compression-matrix.md)** - Active - Comprehensive operationalization (1,343 lines) of [Role × Layer × Phase] decision framework.

**[Multi-Role Document Strategies](patterns/multi-role-document-strategies.md)** - Active - Comprehensive guide (1,208 lines) for optimizing multi-audience documents.

**[Ultra-Aggressive Compression Methods](patterns/ultra-aggressive-compression.md)** - Active - Comprehensive guide (816 lines) for 95-99% compression techniques.

**[Tool Integration Guide](patterns/tool-integration-guide.md)** - Active - Comprehensive implementation guide (1,927 lines) for integrating compression with tools and workflows.
