### Analysis

**[Documentation Types Matrix](analysis/documentation-types-matrix.md)** - Active - Comprehensive taxonomy (1,030 lines) defining six audience categories (LLM-only, hybrid-technical, hybrid-general, human-technical, human-general, archival) with specific compression targets (70-85%, 40-60%, 20-40%, 0-10%, 0%, 95-99%). Includes decision framework, comprehension requirements, and 7 example transformations.

**[Information Preservation Framework](analysis/information-preservation-framework.md)** - Active - Systematic framework (919 lines) for purpose-driven compression. Comprehensive taxonomy of 7 documentation purposes (execution, learning, reference, audit, communication, analysis, maintenance) with essential information mapping, preservation decision matrices, 5 compression methods, validation framework, and systematic analysis process. Answers "what can be safely stripped" based on "why we're documenting."
