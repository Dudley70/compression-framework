# Session State - 2025-10-29

## WHERE WE ARE
Project scope defined and initial research materials imported. Two compression methods now documented: LSC (documentation compression, 70-85%) and Context Compression Method (conversational compression, 99.5%). Ready to begin systematic evaluation and testing.

## ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION
- Initialized project structure at /Users/dudley/Projects/Compression
- Created docs/ organization with all standard categories
- Initialized git repository (commits: e3c8f06, 36b20ff)
- Copied LSC framework from Claude_Templates/LSC/ to docs/research/lsc/
  - LSC_CONTEXT_EFFICIENCY.md (3,247 lines - complete framework)
  - README.md (quick reference)
- Copied context-compression-method.md from CC_Projects to docs/research/
- Updated docs/INDEX.md with research documentation entries
- Updated PROJECT.md with comprehensive scope and strategic context
- Defined project as research/test/evaluation of compression methods

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Create evaluation plan in docs/plans/
2. Establish baseline metrics and test cases
3. Define evaluation criteria for comparing methods
4. Identify optimal use cases for each method
5. Create test implementations
6. Consider additional compression techniques to research

## RECOVERY CONTEXT
If session interrupted:
- Project fully initialized with two baseline compression methods documented
- LSC: Machine-first structured format for documentation (70-85% token reduction)
- Context Compression: Post-session conversational compression (99.5% compression)
- Both methods complementary - LSC for proactive documentation, Context Compression for retrospective conversation summaries
- All source materials copied to docs/research/
- Git repository active, clean working tree
- Ready for evaluation framework development

## FILES MODIFIED
- Created: docs/research/lsc/LSC_CONTEXT_EFFICIENCY.md (copied)
- Created: docs/research/lsc/README.md (copied)
- Created: docs/research/context-compression-method.md (copied)
- Updated: docs/INDEX.md (added research entries)
- Updated: PROJECT.md (scope and strategic context)
- Updated: SESSION.md (this file)
- Ready to commit

## BLOCKERS
None. Ready to proceed with evaluation framework.

## NOTES
- Two distinct compression approaches imported:
  - LSC: Proactive, machine-first documentation format
  - Context Compression: Retrospective, conversation summarization
- Methods are complementary, not competing
- Strong foundation for systematic evaluation
- Source materials preserved in original locations
