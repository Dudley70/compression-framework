Phase 4: Structure (30-50%) - Clarity over brevity
Phase 5: Build (50-70%) - Execution efficiency
Phase 6: Maintain (Variable) - Active 40-60%, Archive 95-99%

Document States: Active → Complete (+15-25%) → Archive (+30-50%)
Anti-Compression Patterns: 7 situations when NOT to compress
Phase Transitions: Best practices and decision tree
```

**Part 10: ROI and Prioritization** (~330 lines)
```
ROI Formula: (Frequency × Potential × Size) / Effort

High-ROI Targets:
- Session startup (CRITICAL): Score 100 - Every session
- Daily operational (HIGH): Score 20-30 - Frequent access
- Strategic reference (MEDIUM): Score 3-10 - Periodic
- Archive (LOW impact): Score 2-3 - Rare access

Validation Rigor: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
Decision Rationale: Preserve "why not" for maintainers
Frequency Tracking: Empirical monitoring recommended
```

**Key Innovations:**
1. Phase-appropriate compression prevents premature compression
2. Anti-compression patterns formalize "when NOT to compress"
3. State transitions enable progressive compression
4. ROI prioritization focuses on high-impact documents
5. Decision rationale preservation maintains institutional knowledge

**Total Framework:** 5,931 lines of systematic methodology

**Next Milestone:** Complete Session 3 (multi-role patterns) to finish all HIGH priority gaps

### Gap Progress Tracker

**From Alignment Review (6 gaps identified):**

**HIGH Priority (Must Have):**
- ✓ Gap 1: Multi-dimensional decision framework (Session 1) - COMPLETE
- ✓ Gap 2: Phase-aware compression guidance (Session 2) - COMPLETE
- ⏳ Gap 3: Multi-role document patterns (Session 3) - NEXT
- ✓ Gap 4: ROI / frequency prioritization (Session 2) - COMPLETE

**MEDIUM Priority (Should Have):**
- ⏳ Gap 5: Archive compression beyond 85% (Session 4) - PLANNED
- ⏳ Gap 6: Tool integration considerations (Session 5) - PLANNED

**Progress:** 3 of 6 gaps complete (50%), 3 of 4 HIGH priority complete (75%)

**Risk:** LOW - On track, clear path forward, 1 HIGH priority gap remaining

### Framework Integration Status

**How Components Work Together:**

**1. Documentation Types Matrix** (WHO)
- Defines 6 audience categories
- Maps to CC_Projects H2 roles
- Provides base compression ranges

**2. Multi-Dimensional Compression Matrix** (HOW)
- Operationalizes [Role × Layer × Phase] decisions
- Provides quantitative targets
- Includes conflict resolution
- Base: 6 Roles × 5 Layers
- Adjustments: Phase (-30% to +30%), Mode-switching (-15% to +15%)

**3. Information Preservation Framework** (WHY + WHEN)
- Defines 7 documentation purposes
- Phase-aware compression strategy (6 phases)
- ROI prioritization framework
- Anti-compression patterns
- Preservation requirements per purpose

**Together:**
- Matrix: Quantitative targets for any document
- Framework: Purpose and phase context for those targets
- Result: Complete compression decision system

**Remaining:** Multi-role patterns (Session 3) to handle documents serving multiple roles

### Session 2 Key Insights

**1. Phase Lifecycle is Critical to Compression**
- Ideation/Research: Need LOW compression (space and evidence)
- Build/Maintain-Archive: Enable HIGH compression (efficiency and storage)
- Premature compression during creative phases kills value
- Progressive compression through phase transitions

**2. ROI Drives Practical Prioritization**
- Session startup documents = CRITICAL (loaded every session, massive cumulative impact)
- Frequency matters more than size alone
- H4 validation: 70-85% reduction on high-frequency docs = 1-3% overall overhead reduction
- Prioritization formula: (Frequency × Potential × Size) / Effort

**3. Anti-Compression Patterns Prevent Common Mistakes**
- Formalized 7 situations when NOT to compress
- Overhead vs benefit principle
- Recognizing when compression premature or harmful

**4. Document State Transitions Create Natural Opportunities**
- Active → Complete: +15-25% compression
- Complete → Archive: +30-50% more (95-99% total)
- Progressive compression aligned with document lifecycle

**5. Decision Rationale = Future Maintainer Value**
- "Why not X" prevents repeated analysis
- Preservation strategy by alternative type
- Selected: full detail, Considered: moderate, Dismissed: minimal

**6. Validation Rigor Should Scale with Impact**
- CRITICAL docs (session startup): Functional testing, rigorous
- LOW impact (archive): Searchability, minimal
- Efficiency through appropriate effort matching stakes
