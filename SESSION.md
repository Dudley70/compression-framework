## Session Status: 2025-10-30 14:30 AEDT (Active)

### WHERE WE ARE
**Phase**: Validation - Phase 1 Complete (100%), Phase 2 Partial (60% overall)

Session 8 completed MVP validation through autonomous Claude Code delegation. All 3 MVP tasks production-ready with 54/54 tests passing. Framework at 11,800 lines. Two remaining validation tasks (Content Analyzer, Safety Checks) have comprehensive specs ready for delegation.

### ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION
- Session initialized and context established
- Git status clean except SESSION.md
- Latest commit: e775336 "docs: Session 8 complete - MVP validation 100%, Phase 2 50% complete"

### NEXT ACTIONS
1. Review validation status with user - determine priorities
2. Option A: Complete Phase 2 validation (Tasks 1.1 + 2.3 via Claude Code delegation)
3. Option B: Other research or analysis tasks
4. Option C: Begin tool MVP development preparation

### RECOVERY CONTEXT
**From Session 8** (per Decision #7):
- Autonomous delegation proven effective: ~15 min/task vs 3-10 hours interactive
- MVP validation complete: Compression Score, Token Drift, Round-Trip Test
- All implementations production-ready on first attempt (100% test pass rate)
- Pattern established: comprehensive task specs → autonomous execution → quality results

**Remaining Validation Tasks** (both ready for delegation):
- Task 1.1: Content Analyzer (700 lines) - document parsing and metrics
- Task 2.3: Safety Checks (795 lines) - comprehensive safety validation

### ACTIVE FILES
- SESSION.md (this file)
- PROJECT.md (strategic context)
- claude-code-tasks/TASK_1.1_content_analyzer.md (700 lines, ready)
- claude-code-tasks/TASK_2.3_safety_checks.md (795 lines, ready)

### BLOCKERS
None

### NOTES
- Framework complete: 11,800 lines across 10 documents
- Unified theory established: (σ, γ, κ) parameter optimization
- MVP validation: 100% complete (3/3 tasks)
- Test coverage: 54/54 passing
- Autonomous delegation pattern proven effective
- Ready to complete Phase 2 validation or pivot to tool development

### GIT STATE
On branch main
Clean (SESSION.md uncommitted - will commit with session work)
