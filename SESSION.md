# Session State - 2025-10-29

## WHERE WE ARE
Major analytical frameworks complete. Two comprehensive analyses now provide systematic methods for determining what to preserve and how to compress based on audience and purpose.

## ACCOMPLISHED THIS SESSION
- Initialized project structure
- Imported baseline compression methods (LSC + Context Compression)
- Created Documentation Types Matrix (1,030 lines)
  - Six audience categories with compression targets
  - Technical vs general literacy distinction
- **Created Information Preservation Framework (919 lines)**
  - Comprehensive taxonomy of 7 documentation purposes
  - Essential information mapping by purpose
  - Systematic analysis method (6 steps)
  - 5 compression methods with examples
  - Validation framework
  - Decision matrices and best practices

## KEY FRAMEWORKS

### Documentation Types Matrix
**Question**: "Who is the audience and what's the format?"
**Answer**: Six categories with compression targets
- LLM-only: 70-85%
- Hybrid-Technical: 40-60%
- Hybrid-General: 20-40%
- Human-Technical: 0-10%
- Human-General: 0%
- Archival: 95-99%

### Information Preservation Framework
**Question**: "What can be safely stripped based on why we're documenting?"
**Answer**: Purpose-driven preservation with systematic method
- 7 purposes: execution, learning, reference, audit, communication, analysis, maintenance
- Essential information mapping per purpose
- Preservation decision matrix (union of all purposes)
- 5 compression methods: structural, summary, reference, layered, temporal
- Validation framework with testing methods

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Create test corpus with real document samples
2. Apply both frameworks to examples
3. Demonstrate systematic analysis method
4. Validate compression against multiple purposes
5. Create practical templates and tools
6. Document empirical findings

## RECOVERY CONTEXT
If session interrupted:
- Two major analytical frameworks complete
- Documentation Types Matrix: audience-driven (who reads it)
- Information Preservation Framework: purpose-driven (why it exists)
- Frameworks are complementary: use both together
- Types Matrix answers "how much compression for this audience"
- Preservation Framework answers "what must be kept for these purposes"
- Ready for practical application and testing

## FILES MODIFIED
- Created: docs/analysis/information-preservation-framework.md (919 lines)
- Updated: docs/INDEX.md (added preservation framework)
- Updated: SESSION.md (this file)
- Ready to commit

## BLOCKERS
None. Analytical foundation complete, ready for empirical testing.

## NOTES
- Information Preservation Framework answers the critical question: "What can be stripped?"
- Purpose determines what's essential (execution needs less than learning/audit)
- Most documents serve multiple purposes → preserve union of essential info
- Framework provides systematic 6-step analysis method
- 5 compression methods with clear use cases
- Validation framework prevents information loss
- Best practices emphasize preservation over aggressive compression
- Temporal compression: purpose changes over document lifecycle
- Next phase: apply frameworks to real documents and validate empirically
